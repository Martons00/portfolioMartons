Originally from **Arienzo**, Italy, I now live in **Nice, France**. My journey has been anything but linear, blending technical rigor with creative expression. Here's a deeper look into who I am, what drives me, and where I'm headed.",

During my university years and time at **Apple Academy**, I lived in the city and became so attached to its spirit—the resilience, history, and authentic character—that I decided to immortalize it with a **Vesuvio tattoo**. My time living in **Turin** and now based in **Nice** has only deepened my appreciation for Naples and what it represents: a place where struggles breed **creativity** and where nothing is ever taken for granted. I'm not Neapolitan by birth, but I am **by choice**."

                "At **25**, I'd describe myself as paradoxically **social**. I thrive on challenging myself, though I'm my own harshest critic—I simply cannot leave things unfinished. I carry a **dual nature**: the **analytical mind** of an engineer paired with the **creative spirit** of a dancer and performer. This duality isn't a contradiction for me; it's the core of how I approach **problem-solving** and creation. The tension between these two sides pushes me to think differently and build better.",
                "Living away from home first in Turin, then abroad in Nice, has been **transformative**. It's forced me to confront who I am outside my comfort zone, accelerating my **self-discovery** and pushing me to become more **independent** and intentional about my choices."

It's an ascending technology that captivated me immediately, and I genuinely believe it will **reshape how people live and work** in the years ahead. More than that, I'm fascinated by the **versatility** and **untapped potential**—the ability to tackle problems once deemed impossible for machines, finding new applications and solving challenges we haven't even imagined yet. Every day, AI redefines what's possible, and I want to be part of that **redefinition**."

I'm drawn to technologies that let me bridge the gap between **engineering rigor** and **creative expression**. I'm not interested in becoming a specialist in one narrow domain; I want to maintain **flexibility** and continue experimenting across different domains."

Consulting taught me what I don't want; now I'm searching for an environment where **growth** and **innovation** are the core rhythm, not the exception."

This isn't just a hobby; it's a **foundational part** of who I am. Dance taught me **rhythm**, **resilience**, and how to translate **emotion into movement**—skills that surprisingly translate well into problem-solving and creative thinking in tech."

I spend considerable time watching **football** and listening to football podcasts, general news deep-dives, and **true crime** narratives. I game when I can, though I'll admit I'm not the most skilled player. These aren't distractions; they're how I **decompress** and stay curious about storytelling, strategy, and culture."
